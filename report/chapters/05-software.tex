\section{Software design}
some general info

\subsection{Peripherals} %please think about the appropriate name!
The description of our modular architecture, the work principles of the separate modules and basically "how we control the peripherals" such as motors, leds, timers, etc. Logic comes a bit later in here.
Also all info on DMA and pin remapping and our pretty mapping table are also welcomed here I think

\subsubsection*{Timer 1}
Short description on how we worked out the time

\subsubsection*{Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)}
how we chose the parameters

\subsubsection*{Quadrature Encoder Inferface(QEI)}
how does qei work?

\subsubsection*{Analogue-to-Digital Conversion(ADC)}

\subsubsection*{Direct Memory Access (DMA) - does this belong here?}

\subsubsection*{Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART)}


\subsection{Pin Mapping}
maybe a diagram of which peripheral maps to which pin


\subsection{Controller Design and Approach}

Here goes the whole logic of the mouse movement control (how should it behave when is faced with the wall or on contrary - with the gap in the labyrinth). PID controller design and the logic behind it.

\subsubsection{Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller (PID)}

\subsubsection{State Machine}

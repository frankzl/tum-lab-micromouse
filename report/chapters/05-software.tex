\subsection{Primary configuration}

\subsubsection*{Configuration bits}

Configuration bits define the microcontroller’s behaviour and enable to set its essential features (Watchdog timer, System Clock Oscillator mode, Phase-Locked Loop, ...).\\
These settings are required before the program starts to run and cannot be changed during the run-time.\\
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent

We invoke pre-processors macros to set the device configuration bits in the main header file.\\
In the main c file, we configure PLL to set the internal clock frequency, call all initialization functions for each of the modules and finally run an infinite background loop so that the system never stops.
\vskip 0.2in
\noindent
\textbf{Oscillator setup}
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent
Configure Phase Lock Loop (PLL) for the system clock reference at 40MHz
	$$F_{IN} (Oscillator frequency) = 16MHz  $$
    $$F_{OSC} (Clock frequency) =  80MHz$$
 	$$F_{CY} = 1/2 * F_{OSC} = 1/2 * (F_{IN}*M/(N1*N2)) = 0.5 * (16MHz*20/(2*2)) = 40 MIPS$$
$$Fcy=40Mhz, Tcy=25ns$$
After the PLL setup, we wait in while loop, for PLL to lock, i.e. stabilize.

\subsubsection*{Pin Mapping}

Peripheral Pin Select (PPS) allows the programmer to map the I/O of most digital peripherals to a selection of pins using an internal switch matrix.
PPS capable pins are identified in the pinout with the designation RPn, with n the port’s pin number.
\vskip 0.2in
\noindent
\textit{Strategy for pin choice}
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent
We start by selecting fixed pins for the following modules / functions: A2D, PWM, OSCL, Programmer, MCLR. We then, find a pin mapping for the rest of the peripherals from the remappable pins that optimizes the PCB wiring.

\vskip 0.2in
\noindent
\textit{Software:}
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent
Before performing pin remapping, we unlock the oscillator, configure the pin mapping, lock the oscillator (enable it again) and wait for a short delay for the remapping to stabilize.\\
The setup differs between input and output pins. For input pin mapping, we need to configure the pin number to the peripheral register. For output pin mapping, we choose the pin register and then map it to the corresponding device code (table 11-2 in mcu datasheet \cite{mcu})

\subsection{Peripherals}
\subsubsection*{Timer 1}
The dsPIC33F device family offers several 16-bit Timer modules. We use the timer 1 to function as a real time clock that generate cyclic internal events.\\
We set the timer period to 10ms, which is derived from the external oscillator clock.
$$tick=prescaler*T_{CY}= 64*25ns= 1.6us $$
We derive the maximum count with:
$$max\_count=(10 ms)/tick=6250 (6250<2^{16}-1)$$

Hence, we set the period \textbf{PR = 6250 - 1} with a prescaler of \textbf{64}. We choose a high prescaler due to reasons mentioned in \ref{subsec:timer}

\subsubsection*{Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)}

Pulse Width Modulation allows us to control the amount of energy supplied to an actuator. In this case we use the PWM signal to drive our motors and control their speed. Using different pulse widths, we can supply different amount of power to our motors. \cite{alex}
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent
We want to set the registers, such that we achieve a frequency of 20 kHz.
$$f_{PWM} = 20 kHz$$
$$T_{PWM} = \frac{1}{f_{PWM}} = 50 us$$

We fix the prescaler to be \textbf{1}. Given that $T_{PWM} = 50 us$ and $T_{CY}=25 ns$, we conclude:

$$T_{PWM} = prescaler * T_{CY} * (PTPER + 1)$$
$$\iff PTPER = \frac{T_{PWM}}{T_{CY}} - 1  = 2000 - 1 = 1999$$
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent
Depending on our PWM period, we get different amount of ripple in our resulting signal. More on this can be found in \cite[Chapter~5.1]{alex}.
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent
Our PWM duty cycle can take the following values: $PDC \in [0, 2*(P1TPER + 1)] = [0, 4000]$


\subsubsection*{Quadrature Encoder Inferface(QEI)}
To measure the position and velocity of our motors, we are provided with a \textit{quadrature encoder}.
The following values are set twice for each motor (left and right).
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent
Our motor from the Faulhaber 2619 series posesses 16 lines per revolution. If we were to measure only the amount of times light is registered on the photo-transistors, the maximum counts for one revolution would be 16. But since we can also count the times it turns off, we can go up to 32 measurements per revolution. Lastly taking the two channels, A and B, into consideration, we get 64 counts per revolution.
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent
We call this setting \textbf{edge gain}. In our case we have set it to 4 to achieve 64 counts per revolution.
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent
Our $POSCNT$ stores the current position of our wheel and our $MAXCNT$ register stores the maximum value we count to.
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent
We set $MAXCNT$ to the maximum possible value \textbf{0xffff} and $POSCNT$ to half of it.


\subsubsection*{Analogue-to-Digital Conversion(ADC)}

To convert the analogue sensor values to digital values that can be processed by the controller, we configure the ADC module. \\
We sample three analogue channels for our three sensors: AN4, AN6, AN8 using a configuration with 12-bit conversion (output is an unsigned integer) and one sample and hold unit.
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent
In a general configuration, ADC raises an interrupt when all the configured channels have been sampled and the results are available on the 16-bit ADC buffers but Since our device has a DMA module, the storing of converted values can be automated without the need of CPU involvement and disable the ADC interrupt.
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent
\textbf{Sampling and conversion settings:}
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent
Requirements from datasheet table 31-16:
\begin{itemize}
    \item minimum conversion clock $T_{AD} = 117.6 ns$
    \item minimum acquisition time $T_{ACQ}=3*tad= 352.8ns $
    \item maximum sampling rate for 12 bit conversion is 500 Ksps
\end{itemize}
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent
We derive the ADC Conversion Clock from the system clock with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Conversion clock: $T_{AD}=T_{CY}*(ADCS+1)= T_{CY}*8 = 8/40M= 200ns (200ns>117.6ns)$
    \item Acquisition time: $T_{ACQ}= SAMC*T_{AD}= 5*T_{AD}=1us (1us>352.8ns)$
    \item ADC total Conversion time (12 bit): $T_{CONV}=14*T_{AD}=2.8us$
    \item sampling rate (user 10ms timer) is 100sps ($100sps < 500Ksps$)
\end{itemize}
$$T_{SAMP}-(T_{ACQ}+T_{CONV})*3=10ms-6us$$
Hence, we have enough margin since the sampling starts not immediately after last conversion but when ASAM bit is set in timer ISR.
\vskip 0.2in
\noindent
\textbf{Remarks}
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent
If the acquisition time is too short, the sample and hold will not settle and the accuracy will decrease.\\
During the conversion the capacitor is discharging. If the conversion time is too long, we lose accuracy. \\
We tried to find a trade-off between to ensure optimal accuracy.

\subsubsection*{Direct Memory Access (DMA)}

We define a DMA data buffer adcData, a global variable where all conversion results are stored in the same order in which the conversions are performed by the ADC module.\\
We store one sample per channel and generate an interrupt after the three channel values have been transferred. The interrupt service routine stops the sampling that is again started at each timer interrupt call.
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent
We set the dma operating mode to a peripheral indirect addressing mode ((peripheral generates destination address [increment by 2]) and a continuous no ping pong setting (continuous transfer of data with the same buffer start address) as shown in the figure below:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/software/DMA.png}
    \caption{DMA continuous no ping pong mode}
    \label{fig:dma}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART)}
Our dsPIC33FJ64MC804 has a Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART)  module for serial port communication.
The UART can communicate with peripheral devices.
In our case, we use it to commmunicate with an outside computer to send commands or read out values. This was especially useful to find fitting parameters for our gains in the controller logic (chapter).

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/software/uart_demo.png}
    \caption {String transmission of 8 bit characters with one start bit and one stop bit (no parity) \cite{alex}}
    \label{fig:uart_demo}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:uart_demo} shows the transmission of a string consisting of three characters.
The dsPIC33FJ64MC804 allows us to specify the properties of our transmission. The most important settings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Baud rate: 57.6 kbit/s
    \item Data Selection Bits: 8
    \item Parity bit: 0
    \item Stop bit: 1
\end{itemize}

In order to send out messages, we require another module. We therefore connect our microcontroller to the \textbf{HC-05 Bluetooth Module} (figure \ref{fig:hc_05} so that we can send messages to that module which again transfers those messages via bluetooth to our computer where we read out the values.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
          \centering
            \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{figures/software/uart_hc05.jpg}

    \end{minipage}%
    \begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}

                \label{fig:wire_3}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The 3-wire UART as seen in figure \ref{fig:wire_3} shows our configuration for a full-duplex communication. The Bluetooth module sends out the message it gets on the reception line (Rx) and sends back messages to the microcontroller through its transmission line (Tx). To receive the message from our microcontroller, we need to connect our computer to the HC-05 module via bluetooth.

It is important to configure the baud rate of the HC-05 module in advance, such that it matches our microcontroller's baud rate. Also, in order to read out values, the baud rate on the PC we are reading from, must also match (in this case 57.6 kbit/s)

\subsection{PID Controller Design}

In the following section we describe the motivation, analysis and tests performed to implement a PID controller and describe how it enables the robot's speed and position control.

\subsubsection{Motor speed control}
To control the motor velocity, we use a drive function that takes as input the DC ratio and sets the PWM PDC register accordingly. \\
\noindent
This leads the motor to run at a constant speed: $$V=DC*maxspeed$$ with maxspeed=68 (68 corresponds to the number of counts per interrupt call, i.e. 10ms). \\
\vskip 0.2in
\noindent
The function also considers the sign of the input to set the driving direction (a position DC value implies going forward and vice versa)\\
\vskip 0.2in
\noindent
\textbf{Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We first make a sanity check to ensure that the input value falls in the range $[-100, 100]$
    \item Since the motor only supports up to 6V input voltage, we multiply the PDC value with the factor 6/9 since we use a battery that outputs 9V.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller (PID)}

The robot velocity is controlled by varying the PWM duty cycle but it is not guaranteed that the motor is driving exactly at this value. A feedback mechanism is necessary to control and verify this value.\\
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent
A proportional-integral-derivative controller (PID) is a control loop feedback mechanism widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control. A PID controller continuously calculates an error value $e(t)$ as the difference between a desired \textbf{setpoint ($SP$)} and a measured \textbf{process variable ($PV$)} and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms. The output $u(t)$ depends on our use case. This becomes more clear when we look at our motors.\\
The overall control function can be expressed mathematically as : 
$$u(t)= K_{p}*e(t) + K_{i}*\int_t e(t) dt + K_{d}*\frac{d e(t)}{dt} $$
$$e(t) = SP - PV$$
 
where $K_p$, $K_i$, and $K_d$, all non-negative, denote the coefficients for the proportional, integral, and derivative terms respectively, also known as gains.

\subsubsection*{PID for velocity control}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
    \centering
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
            width=6cm,
            xlabel=Duty Cycle(\%),
            ylabel=Velocity (cp10)]
        \addplot table [x=DC(percentage), y=Velocity(cp10)]{figures/data/V_DC.dat};
    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Effect of the duty cycle on the motor velocity} \label{fig:DC_V}
\end{wrapfigure}


A PID controller controls a variable by manipulating the responsible parameters. In our case, we want to control the velocity of the motor by varying the duty cycle. 

We have two definitions of velocity: counts per second ($v_{cps}$ and angular velocity ($v_\omega$).
$$v_{cps}(n) = \frac{POSCNT(n) - POSCNT(n-1)}{T_{update}}$$
$$v_{\omega}(n) = v_{cps}(n) * \frac{\omega_{base}}{k_{E}*Gr}$$

with $k_E$ as our edge gain, $\omega_{base} = \frac{2\pi}{16}$ as our base angular resolution and $Gr$ as our gearing ratio of the gearbox.
\\\\
Since we want to control our motor velocity, it is sufficient to work with $v_{cps}$ instead of $v_{\omega}$. 
The velocity is measured once every 10 ms in the timer interrupt.
We therefore introduce our new velocity ``clicks per 10 ms'' ($v_{cp10}$) so that we require one less computation.

$$v_{cp10} = POSCNT(n) - POSCNT(n-1)$$

For the following sections, any velocity measured, is actually $v_{cp10}$.
\\\\
\textbf{Note: All measurements in the PID sections were taken using the breadboard (figure \ref{fig:breadboard}) as we did not manage to finish the final micromouse in time.}
\\\\
As seen in figure \ref{fig:DC_V} the increase in the velocity decreases down for higher duty cycle values. The maximum measured velocity is 67 cp10. When we want to drive the motor at a certain speed, we cannot expect the corresponding DC percentage to be the same at all times. Errors might occur such that we need slightly different DC values every time.
Using the output of the PID controller, we shall regulate the duty cycle to maintain a certain velocity.

\subsubsection{Effect of PID Gains}
In this section different gain values for the PID controller are tested out to figure out the most suitable ones for our motors.
\subsubsection*{P term}

            legend pos=south east,

    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{P-Controller (P=1): Targeting different velocities} \label{fig:P1}
\end{wrapfigure}
Initially, we only want to observe the effect of the ``P term''.
KP is proportional to the current value of the error.
\\A simple P-controller cannot actually maintain the target value. The system settles in a steady state error since it requires an error to generate the proportional response.
The closer we get to our target value, the lower our P-controller output will become. Hence, if we were to reach the target value, the error would become zero and we would drive the motor with a duty cycle of 0\%.
\\\\
\textbf{Idea:} To figure out an initial $K_p$, we look at the following scenario:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We are driving the motor with maximum speed in clockwise direction. ($67$ cp10)
    \item We now want to drive with maximum speed in the opposite direction. ($-67$ cp10)
\end{enumerate}
Hence, the absolute maximum error value fed into our PID controller will always be
\\$| 67 - (-67)| = 134$. The maximum force to drive our motor is a 100\%.
So in the described scenario, we would flip the direction bits of the motor and drive it with 100\% duty cycle to correct the error.\\
Just considering the P-controller, we come up with the following gain:
$$e_{max} = 134$$
$$u(t) = K_p * 134 \stackrel{!}{=} 100 (\%)$$
$$\iff K_p = \frac{100}{134} \approx 0.75$$\\

Unfortunately, this does not help us reach our desired velocities. In figure \ref{fig:P1} we have already tested a gain value of 1 ($>0.75$) and have not reached the target.\\\\
In order to choose a suitable value for $K_p$, we first figure out the effect of larger $K_p$ values on the final velocity.
\\

\end{figure}
In figure \ref{fig:P_demo} the effect of different gain values $K_p$ on the velocity is plotted. The desired velocity was set to 67 in all cases. A higher value for $K_p$ allows the controller to get closer to the actual desired velocity and it also leads to a higher gradient initially. So not only do we get closer to our desired velocity, but we also reach it faster.\\

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.45\textwidth}
    \centering
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
            legend pos=south east,

    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{P-Controller (P=30): Targeting different velocities} \label{fig:P30}
\end{wrapfigure}
Looking at the results, it might appear that setting the gain $K_p = 30$ solves our problem since we can actually get very close to 67. If we use that gain value to set different velocity values, we observe higher oscillation (see figure \ref{fig:P30}.\\
By setting the $K_p$ to a very high value, the controller becomes more affected by small error values. Even small errors are scaled up by our $K_p$ such that they strongly influence the output of the controller.

$$u(t) = K_p * e(t)$$
$$|e(t)| > 0 \wedge K_p \gg 1 \Rightarrow u(t) \gg 0$$\\\\

This observation can obviously not be made for the velocity of 67, as it is our maximum velocity and the P-controller will never fully reach that value. There is no significant oscillation for the maximum value. For the further tests, we target the velocity 47 so that we are able to observe these effects.

\subsubsection*{I term}
The I term in the PID accounts for past values of the error and integrates them over time to produce the I term. (In the code we sum up all the previous error values.)
Introducing the I term, solves the previous problem with a historic cumulative value of the error. It allows us to reach the actual desired velocity.\\\\
We have measured the effect of different $K_i$ values on our velocity and plotted the values in figure \ref{fig:I_demo}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
\begin{tikzpicture}

    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{PI-Controller (P=0): Targeting velocity 47 with different I values} \label{fig:I_demo}
\end{figure}

Introducing the $K_i$ helps us reach the value, but a further increase of the $K_i$ gain causes stronger oscillation around the targeted value. When the gain $K_i$ is set to 5, the oscillation in speed continues even after one second. For lower gain values the velocity converges faster to our desired velocity. We keep this in mind when we choose our final gains.

\subsubsection*{Clamping I term and PID output}

The integral term can grow very largely through time, especially when the set point cannot be reached and may lead to a saturating the output or inducing a lag of the response in the step down, i.e. when decreasing the setpoint. For this reason, it’s necessary to limit this term in our implementation.\\
Since the controller registers have a limit, it is also necessary to limit the output of the controller for sanity check. 

\subsubsection*{D term}
The D term
$K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt}$
is the slope of our error curve. To observe the effect of the D term, we assign our $K_p$ and $K_i$ gains the fixed values of 1.

\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:D_demo} the $K_d$ value has an effect on the oscillation of our velocity. A higher $K_p$ dampens the oscillation around the setpoint. The period of the oscillations is also higher.\\\\
Because we are already reach the targeted velocity with a PI-controller - as seen in the \textit{I term} section - we do not investigate the effect of the D term further. It is sufficient for our project to use a PI-controller.\\\\

\subsubsection{Choice of PI(D) Gains}
From our previous experiments we concluded that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $K_p$ is responsible for getting close to our setpoint and the duration it takes to get there.
    \item $K_i$ is responsible to actually get to the setpoint
    \item $K_d$ is responsible for dampening the oscillation potentially caused by the P and I term.
\end{enumerate}

As mentioned, we simplify our PID controller and ignore the D part. We start out by choosing the $K_p$ gain.

\subsubsection*{Choosing $K_p$}
Targeting the velocity of 47 with different $K_p$ gains, results in the curves in figure \ref{fig:P_final}. 
For our $K_p$ choice we keep in mind:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We want to add an I term later with a $K_i$ gain. The P-controller alone should therefore not reach our targeted velocity so that adding the I term will not cause our controller to overshoot our target.
    \item The velocity curve should have a high gradient in the beginning so that it can reach our setpoint quickly.
    \item The velocity curve should not oscillate.
\end{enumerate}
With these criteria in mind, we pick $K_p = 8$ as its curve quickly ascends close to our setpoint without overshooting and oscillating strongly.

\subsubsection*{Choosing $K_i$}
We keep the found $K_p$ value fixed to 8 and optimize the $K_i$ value to reach the velocity 47 again (see figure \ref{fig:I_final})

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
            legend pos=outer north east,
            width=10cm,
            xlabel=Time (ms),
            ylabel=Velocity (cp10)]
        \addplot [mark=none, orange] table [x=time(ms), y=PI0]{figures/data/I_final.csv};
        \addlegendentry{P=8, I=0}
        \addplot [mark=none, blue] table [x=time(ms), y=PI81]{figures/data/I_final.csv};
        \addlegendentry{P=8, I=1}
        \addplot [mark=none, red] table [x=time(ms), y=PI805]{figures/data/I_final.csv};
        \addlegendentry{P=8, I=0.5}
        \addplot [mark=none, green] table [x=time(ms), y=PI802]{figures/data/I_final.csv};
        \addlegendentry{P=8, I=0.2}
        \addplot [mark=none, black, dotted] table [x=time(ms), y=T47]{figures/data/I_final.csv};
        \addlegendentry{target 47}   

    \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Final PI-Controller (P=8): Targeting velocity 47 with different I values} \label{fig:I_final}
\end{figure}

Following the similar criteria as for the choice of $K_p$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The velocity curve should overshoot the setpoint as little as possible
    \item The oscillation around the setpoint should be as small as possible.
\end{enumerate}
Based on that, we pick $K_i = 0.2$ because it almost perfectly shoots up to our desired setpoint and stops there without oscillating too strongly.

    \end{axis}

    \caption{Final PI-Controller ($P=8, I=0.2$): Targeting different velocities} \label{fig:PI_final}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Test of PI(D) Gains}
Finally, we put the chosen values $K_p = 8$ and $K_i = 0.2$ to the test with different setpoints (see figure \ref{fig:PI_final}). Unsurprisingly, the PI-controller performs best for the setpoint $47$ because we have chosen the gains based on their performance on the setpoint $47$.
But the controller also performs almost as well on all higher setpoints. For the setpoints $<47$ we observe that the velocity overshooots for a short period before it readjusts itself to the setpoint. On average it takes roughly $10-20 ms$ longer compared the setpoint $47$ which is negligible for our application.\\\\
\textbf{Remarks}
If we had used the D term, we might have been able to use a larger I term. Since a high I term causes oscillation and the D term dampens oscillation, the two terms could have balanced each other out. This could yield a better overall result on all setpoints, but requires more tests. Adding one variable complicates the whole problem as it adds another dimension to test in.


\subsubsection*{Cascade controller: position and velocity}

We use two controllers to adjust both the position and speed of each wheel. 
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent
The position control is performed with a simple P-controller whose error is the difference between the measured distance to the wall of the right and left sensors. The goal is to have the robot in the middle of the cell, i.e. with the same distance to the right and left wall.\\
We only need a P-controller because the inertia of the robot leads to an integration (the wheels automatically integrate) as the robot moves on.
\vskip 0.1in
\noindent
The output of this controller (desired velocity) is used as the setpoint for our PI-controller that adjusts the speed of the wheel. It takes as input the error between the desired and current velocity and returns a PDC value that sets the new motor speed.

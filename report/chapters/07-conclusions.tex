\section{Conclusions}
Here - short summary of the achieved results, maybe some general words and praises for our final mouse version, just something positive to end the mouse story well.

\subsection{Expectations}
Slightly controversial part, we could omit it (I would like not to though) or rephrase it somehow. Basically - what did we expect from the course. Not sure if this part actually belongs here, but for now it works.
\subsection{Propositions}
Our suggestions to maybe somehow improve or better organize some parts of the praktikum or the task or whatever.

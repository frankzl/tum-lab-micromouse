\section{Summary of tests} \label{chap:tests}
\textcolor{red}{
Here goes everything practical we could possibly test - for example the speeding curve of the motor, the temperature conditions of the board (when we'll solder it - whether it is able to work without overheating and such) 
Of course, the PID working values (such as the error convergence rate)
Possible subsections:\\
    - casing tests \\
    - schematic tests \\
    - software logic tests \\

During the whole implementation process 
\subsection{Organizational challenges}

\subsection{Software design challenges}
\subsection{PCB design challenges}
\subsection{Casing design challenges}

\textit{Well, here go all the problems we faced coupled with our solutions for them. Potentially the longest part in the report. Can be split in parts similarly to the previous sections (talking about software, board and casing)}

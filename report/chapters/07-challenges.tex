\section{Implementation challenges}
Some general words about our journey with the mouse.

\subsection{Summary of problems encountered}
Well, here go all the problems we faced coupled with our solutions for them. Potentially the longest part in the report. Can be split in parts similarly to the previous sections (talking about software, board and casing)

\subsection{Learning experience} %the name is terrible, please smb name it properly, I'm out of imagination

What we learned basically? What was especially hard to grasp, e.t.c.
We could somehow present it as the short submission from each of us (as well as the previous part) Here we could also put the story of the first half of the semester (at least in the summarized form) and what concepts and practices and stuff we learned from that.

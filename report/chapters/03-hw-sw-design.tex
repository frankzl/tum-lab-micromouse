\section{Hardware and software design}

Some introductory info

\subsection{Hardware design}

    \subsubsection{Board design}

    The complete description of our schematics design and board design and what we did and why
    Also including all calculations we've managed to collect throughout the whole course of said design.
    Pretty pictures and some tables with calculated values would be amazing.

    \subsubsection{Casing design}

    The whole journey on the casing design. Pictures of the final 3D model and printed model of course, some calculations and data on the sizes and maybe geometrical values 
    
\subsection{Software design}

    The description of our modular architecture, the work principles of the separate modules and basically "how we control the peripherals" such as motors, leds, timers, etc. Logic comes a bit later in here.
    Also all info on DMA and pin remapping and our pretty mapping table are also welcomed here I think

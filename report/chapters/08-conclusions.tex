\section{Conclusions}
\textcolor{red}{
Here - short summary of the achieved results, maybe some general words and praises for our final mouse version, just something positive to end the mouse story well.
}

\subsection{Expectations}
\textcolor{red}{
Slightly controversial part, we could omit it (I would like not to though) or rephrase it somehow. Basically - what did we expect from the course. Not sure if this part actually belongs here, but for now it works.
}
\subsection{Proposals}
\textcolor{red}{It's Proposals, not propositions... ;p - fixed :)}
\textcolor{red}{
Our suggestions to maybe somehow improve or better organize some parts of the praktikum or the task or whatever.
Adam: My most important suggestion and feedback:
The document Alex provided us in the beginning was very good and helpful. However, after it, especially when it comes to the
"basic circuit" he provided us with, there was him talking and explaining a lot...but no references!
Explaining is good, but I believe we all lacked some concrete accompanying material, references on books chapters, articles, etc.,
much like the datasheets provided.
In simple words, anything Alex explained on the board should have been referenced. So that students with background have something
solid and students with no background to be empowered to start somewhere!
i would have personally prefered to be overwhelmed with material, than simply been overwhelmed with Alex talking on the board.
In the end why? Because, letting learning aside, I can't reference Alex's words in the report.

\section{Conclusions}
\textcolor{red}{
Here - short summary of the achieved results, maybe some general words and praises for our final mouse version, just something positive to end the mouse story well.

\subsection{Expectations}
\textcolor{red}{
Slightly controversial part, we could omit it (I would like not to though) or rephrase it somehow. Basically - what did we expect from the course. Not sure if this part actually belongs here, but for now it works.

\subsection{Proposals}

\textcolor{red}{We could rephrase the following as personal suggestions or as team, if everyone agrees.}

Adam: It would have been great to have a reference recommendations for everything that came up along the way. I know that we got our hands on many different subjects and issues. Even though Alex is a great and experienced mentor on electronics, it would be nice to provide a reference for everything, from book chapters to articles or papers. For example, the document provided in the beginning was an excellent start, which unfortunately didn't cover much of electronics. This would help inexperienced students catch up with some extra effort and prove to be invaluable for referencing in the final report. All in all, I would use the book Art of Electronics for specific referencing.

Adam: Another proposal. Have a presentation in the middle of the term. I believe the presentation pushed everyone and we really understood what is going on and what the progress is. I personally believe a midterm evaluation of the progress would help motivate more work and identify still points of the project.

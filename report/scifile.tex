\Large \textbf{Contribution to the project}\\

\normalsize Short description of how each Micromouse project member contributed to the final result.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Adam\\
        Code for the old microcontroller, Schematic, PCB Design, Components Order, The entire Hardware part in the report except for Casing section
    \item Frank\\
    \item Meryem\\
    \item Natalia\\
        In the first ("acquiring basic knowledge") half of the semester, due to the previous experience in embedded programming, I was mainly focused on helping other project members to grasp various concepts that were new to them, answering questions regarding the material and implementing the prototypes from weekly exercises on the breadboard.
        After the group reorganization (which followed shortly after the actual work on building the micromouse started) I joined the hardware team and with other team members worked on the first versions of schematics design, performed the initial PCB tracing, contributed to maintaining the component ordering and description tables. 
        Moreover, I tried to help other teams whenever possible as well as to maintain the connection between teams and inform everyone of the current progress.
    \item René\\
         My previous (but little) experience of electrical components, which I acquired during my last bachelor studies, helped me during the building of the first breadboard of our practical course. My task during the practical course within my initial team was often fixing the code in the software. As we reorganized the groups in the second half I joined the hardware team and learned the main skills to operate in Autodesk Eagle. I was partly responsible building the schematic for our own micromouse and building the initial PCB layout. Lastly, the hardware team finished the tracing of the PCB in turns.

% In setting up this template for *Science* papers, we've used both
% the \section* command and the \paragraph* command for topical
% divisions.  Which you use will of course depend on the type of paper
% you're writing.  Review Articles tend to have displayed headings, for
% which \section* is more appropriate; Research Articles, when they have
% formal topical divisions at all, tend to signal them with bold text
% that runs into the paragraph, for which \paragraph* is the right
% choice.  Either way, use the asterisk (*) modifier, as shown, to
% suppress numbering.

Some guidelines from the template
\vspace{5cm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Please follow the style for references outlined at our author
  help site and embodied in recent issues of {\it Science}.  Each
  citation number should refer to a single reference; please do not
  concatenate several references under a single number.
\item Please cite your references and notes in text {\it only\/} using
  the standard \LaTeX\ \verb+\cite+ command, not another command
  driven by outside macros.
\item Please separate multiple citations within a single \verb+\cite+
  command using commas only; there should be {\it no space\/}
  between reference keynames.  That is, if you are citing two
  papers whose bibliography keys are \texttt{keyname1} and
  \texttt{keyname2}, the in-text cite should read
  \verb+\cite{keyname1,keyname2}+, {\it not\/}
  \verb+\cite{keyname1, keyname2}+.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Failure to follow these guidelines could lead
to the omission of the references in an accepted paper when the source
file is translated to Word via HTML.

\section*{Handling Math, Tables, and Figures}

Following are a few things to keep in mind in coding equations,
tables, and figures for submission to {\it Science}.

\paragraph*{In-line math.}  The utility that we use for converting
from \LaTeX\ to HTML handles in-line math relatively well.  It is best
to avoid using built-up fractions in in-line equations, and going for
the more boring ``slash'' presentation whenever possible --- that is,
for \verb+$a/b$+ (which comes out as $a/b$) rather than
\verb+$\frac{a}{b}$+ (which compiles as $\frac{a}{b}$).  Likewise,
HTML isn't tooled to handle certain overaccented special characters
in-line; for $\hat{\alpha}$ (coded \verb+$\hat{\alpha}$+), for
example, the HTML translation code will return [\^{}$(\alpha)$].
Don't drive yourself crazy --- but if it's possible to avoid such
constructs, please do so.  Please do not code arrays or matrices as
in-line math; display them instead.  And please keep your coding as
\TeX-y as possible --- avoid using specialized math macro packages
like \texttt{amstex.sty}.

\paragraph*{Displayed math.} Our HTML converter sets up \TeX\
displayed equations using nested HTML tables.  That works well for an
HTML presentation, but Word chokes when it comes across a nested
table in an HTML file.  We surmount that problem by simply cutting the
displayed equations out of the HTML before it's imported into Word,
and then replacing them in the Word document using either images or
equations generated by a Word equation editor.  Strictly speaking,
this procedure doesn't bear on how you should prepare your manuscript
--- although, for reasons best consigned to a note, we'd
prefer that you use native \TeX\ commands within displayed-math
environments, rather than \LaTeX\ sub-environments.

\paragraph*{Tables.}  The HTML converter that we use seems to handle
reasonably well simple tables generated using the \LaTeX\
\texttt{\{tabular\}} environment.  For very complicated tables, you
may want to consider generating them in a word processing program and
including them as a separate file.

\paragraph*{Figures.}  Figure callouts within the text should not be
in the form of \LaTeX\ references, but should simply be typed in ---
that is, \verb+(Fig. 1)+ rather than \verb+\ref{fig1}+.  For the
figures themselves, treatment can differ depending on whether the
manuscript is an initial submission or a final revision for acceptance
and publication.  For an initial submission and review copy, you can
use the \LaTeX\ \verb+{figure}+ environment and the
\verb+\includegraphics+ command to include your PostScript figures at
the end of the compiled PostScript file.  For the final revision,
however, the \verb+{figure}+ environment should {\it not\/} be used;
instead, the figure captions themselves should be typed in as regular
text at the end of the source file (an example is included here), and
the figures should be uploaded separately according to the Art
Department's instructions.


\section*{What to Send In}

What you should send to {\it Science\/} will depend on the stage your manuscript is in:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Important:} If you're sending in the initial submission of
  your manuscript (that is, the copy for evaluation and peer review),
  please send in {\it only\/} a PostScript or PDF version of the
  compiled file (including figures).  Please do not send in the \TeX\
  source, \texttt{.sty}, \texttt{.bbl}, or other associated files with
  your initial submission.  (For more information, please see the
  instructions at our Web submission site,
  http://www.submit2science.org/ .)
\item When the time comes for you to send in your revised final
  manuscript (i.e., after peer review), we require that you include
  all source files and generated files in your upload.  Thus, if the
  name of your main source document is \texttt{ltxfile.tex}, you
  need to include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{ltxfile.tex}.
\item \texttt{ltxfile.aux}, the auxilliary file generated by the
  compilation.
\item A PostScript file (compiled using \texttt{dvips} or some other
  driver) of the \texttt{.dvi} file generated from
  \texttt{ltxfile.tex}, or a PDF file distilled from that
  PostScript.  You do not need to include the actual \texttt{.dvi}
  file in your upload.
\item From B{\small{IB}}\TeX\ users, your bibliography (\texttt{.bib})
  file, {\it and\/} the generated file \texttt{ltxfile.bbl} created
  when you run B{\small{IB}}\TeX.
\item Any additional \texttt{.sty} and \texttt{.bst} files called by
  the source code (though, for reasons noted earlier, we {\it
    strongly\/} discourage the use of such files beyond those
  mentioned in this document).
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% Your references go at the end of the main text, and before the
% figures.  For this document we've used BibTeX, the .bib file
% scibib.bib, and the .bst file Science.bst.  The package scicite.sty
% was included to format the reference numbers according to *Science*
% style.


\bibliography{scibib}

\bibliographystyle{Science}



% Following is a new environment, {scilastnote}, that's defined in the
% preamble and that allows authors to add a reference at the end of the
% list that's not signaled in the text; such references are used in
% *Science* for acknowledgments of funding, help, etc.


% For your review copy (i.e., the file you initially send in for
% evaluation), you can use the {figure} environment and the
% \includegraphics command to stream your figures into the text, placing
% all figures at the end.  For the final, revised manuscript for
% acceptance and production, however, PostScript or other graphics
% should not be streamed into your compliled file.  Instead, set
% captions as simple paragraphs (with a \noindent tag), setting them
% off from the rest of the text with a \clearpage as shown  below, and
% submit figures as separate files according to the Art Department's
% instructions.

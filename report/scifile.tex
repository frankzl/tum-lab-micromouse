\Large \textbf{Contribution to the project}\\

\normalsize Short description of how each Micromouse project member contributed to the final result.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Adam\\
        Code for the old microcontroller, Schematic, PCB Design, Components Order, The entire Hardware part in the report except for Casing section
    \item Frank\\
    \item Meryem\\
    \item Natalia\\
        In the first ("acquiring basic knowledge") half of the semester, due to the previous experience in embedded programming, I was mainly focused on helping other project members to grasp various concepts that were new to them, answering questions regarding the material and implementing the prototypes from weekly exercises on the breadboard.
        After the group reorganization (which followed shortly after the actual work on building the micromouse started) I joined the hardware team and with other team members worked on the first versions of schematics design, performed the initial PCB tracing, contributed to maintaining the component ordering and description tables. 
        Moreover, I tried to help other teams whenever possible as well as to maintain the connection between teams and inform everyone of the current progress.
    \item René\\
         My previous (but little) experience of electrical components, which I acquired during my last bachelor studies, helped me during the building of the first breadboard of our practical course. My task during the practical course within my initial team was often fixing the code in the software. As we reorganized the groups in the second half I joined the hardware team and learned the main skills to operate in Autodesk Eagle. I was partly responsible building the schematic for our own micromouse and building the initial PCB layout. Lastly, the hardware team finished the tracing of the PCB in turns.
    \item Sihong\\

% In setting up this template for *Science* papers, we've used both
% the \section* command and the \paragraph* command for topical
% divisions.  Which you use will of course depend on the type of paper
% you're writing.  Review Articles tend to have displayed headings, for
% which \section* is more appropriate; Research Articles, when they have
% formal topical divisions at all, tend to signal them with bold text
% that runs into the paragraph, for which \paragraph* is the right
% choice.  Either way, use the asterisk (*) modifier, as shown, to
% suppress numbering.
